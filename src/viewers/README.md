# Spanish to English JSON

Built to provide `wiki-walker` with a list of spanish to english words that can be used to generate questions to learn either english or spanish.

Leveraged the [doozan/spanish_data](https://github.com/doozan/spanish_data) dataset and converted the data over to a json file which should be easier to digest using npm.
